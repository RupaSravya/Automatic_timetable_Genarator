# Automatic_timetable_Genarator using Genetic algorithms

Timetable creation is a very arduous and
time consuming task. Time table is created
for various purposes like to organize
lectures in school and colleges, to create
timing charts for train and bus schedule
and many more.Our Aim isto generate a
timetable which is more accurate, precise
and free of human errors.
Genetic algorithms are
general search 
optimization algorithm
inspired by processes
and normally associated
with natural world.Below are methods used to find out the unique population.  
Data
